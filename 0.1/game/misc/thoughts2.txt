Wow, programming Python really IS fast.  ^_^

Okay, this is gonna kinda build on the trustworthy ol' Edge of Infinity engine
fundamentals.  We're gonna need a resource system and a config file loader.
However, we can simply use XML config files or something similar, and have the
standard library handle it.

Everything --maps, characters, items, maybe conversations, and so on-- is
gonna be in a config file.  Scripting is, hah, trivial.  


SYSTEMS:
Map movement, events, and turn succession
Conversations
Character auxillary --support levels, levelling, weapon skills, promotion
Battle scenes and calculations
Item aquisition and trading
Storyline sequence (later?)
AI
Stat screen


SERVICES:
Sound
Image-loader (check!)
Config-files (check!)
pygame init and destruction
Game-saving
UI and events
Pathing
Global game and system flags
