Okay, this is going to be a Fire Emblem engine.  We're gonna write it in Ruby
and SDL, 'cause that's pretty straightforward.

Program Design:
Driver
  Level
    Convo engine
    Map
    Teams
      Characters
        Items
  Drawer
    Sprite-drawer
    Map-drawer
    Convo-drawer
    Stat-screen drawer
    Combat drawer
    Effects engine
  Combat system
  Config system
  Input
  Sound
  Save/Load
  




Design doc:

* Large scale battles, like FE4.  Waypoints exist, though.
* Support convo's like FE7
* FE7-style magic
* Only 2 holy weapons, the Light and Dark magics.  But, other characters get
unique weapons that only they can use
* 2nd-attacks are speed-based



Pretty much like any FE game.  Things to think about:
* Feats?  Improved crit, meteor/moonlight hit, prayer, wrath.  No pursuit.
Feats will probably be class- or character-specific, but not both.
* Weapon durability?  Maybe good weapons are just rare and weapons are
invincible.  Or they're just fixable.  We can mess with it.
* Weapon proficiencies by class, or gained through experience?
* Should classes directly affect stats and growths and such, or not?  Probably
not, it's more general.


Proposed organization:
Here's how I envision this working:
Eddie: Designer, writer, Man In Charge.  Has final say over everything, 'cause
someone's gotta.  Creativity is not a democracy.
Paul: Artist and sprite-ripper
Simon and David: Coders
